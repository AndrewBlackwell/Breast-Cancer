# Breast Cancer Classification using numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Overview
This repository contains an ML project focused on the classification of breast cancer tumors as either benign or malignant. The project utilizes a dataset to build and evaluate various machine learning models for breast cancer classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which is available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features are used to predict whether the tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

## Contents
- `Breast-Cancer-Classification.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models. It includes both the features and the target labels.
- 
## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AndrewBlackwell/Breast-Cancer.git
   ```

2. Open the `Breast-Cancer-Classification.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using your preferred Python environment (e.g., Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Build and train machine learning models.
   - Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.
   - Visualize the results.

4. Feel free to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to further improve the classification performance.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install these libraries using `pip` or `conda` if they are not already installed.
